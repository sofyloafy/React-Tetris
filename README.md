## Tetris, built in React

* This web app was built using React, which might not always be the chosen language for gaming 🤔 
* However, I used this project as an educational tool to play with React, and in turn, offer people something to play with! 🎮
* At its current stage of development, this game is not mobile friendly as the commands use the arrow keys 📵
* A major future development will include a leadership, so you can keep tabs on how you are ranked, and how far to work to the top! 🎯


### How to play
* Left, right, down to navigate
* ⬆️ to rotate your tetromino clockwise
* Have fun!
